We found out that if we copy everything to Drive, it is only the *shared* notebooks that have access to all the data and the helper code.

We found out that idle VMs on Colab time out after 90 minutes, and the max lifetime for a VM is 12 hours (source: Stackoverflow). We also found out that you can store 15 gb between gmail, drive, and google photos for free, but G-Suite enterprise, business, or education allows for unlimited storage with 5 or more users, and 1 Tb of storage with 4 or fewer users
